# Context Brief: Role-based dashboard content and defaults

**App:** MyDash — Dashboard system
**Spec:** role-based-content
**Platform:** Nextcloud + OpenRegister

## Features (6 total, sorted by market demand)

### role-based feature presence
**demand: 593** | Category: security | **Coverage: mydash**

CAPABILITY: As an IT admin, I want features shown or hidden based on user role, so that staff only see tools relevant to their job. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
1. GIVEN a user assigned the "employee" role, WHEN they open the dashboard, THEN admin-only widgets are not rendered in the DOM.
2. GIVEN an IT admin updates a role's feature permissions, WHEN an affected user reloads the dashboard, THEN the visible feature set reflects the new permissions.
3. GIVEN a user without permission for a feature, WHEN they request the feature's URL directly, THEN the response is a 403 and the feature is not exposed.

### role-based defaults evidence
**demand: 593** | Category: security | **Coverage: mydash**

CAPABILITY: As an IT admin, I want role-based default dashboards seeded from evidence, so that new users see relevant widgets without manual setup. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
1. GIVEN a user is assigned a role, WHEN they first open mydash, THEN the dashboard loads the role's default widget layout.
2. GIVEN an admin updates a role's default layout, WHEN a new user with that role signs in, THEN they receive the updated defaults.
3. GIVEN a user has customized their dashboard, WHEN role defaults change, THEN their personal customizations are preserved and not overwritten.

### role-based card library
**demand: 593** | Category: security | **Coverage: mydash**

CAPABILITY: As an IT admin, I want a role-based card library, so that dashboard cards are only visible to users with appropriate permissions. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
1. GIVEN a card is restricted to the "manager" role, WHEN a user without that role opens the dashboard, THEN the card is not rendered or listed.
2. GIVEN a user holds a role granting card access, WHEN they open the card library, THEN only cards permitted for their roles appear as available to add.
3. GIVEN an admin revokes a role from a user, WHEN that user reloads the dashboard, THEN previously visible role-restricted cards are no longer accessible.

### role + priority layout
**demand: 593** | Category: security | **Coverage: mydash**

CAPABILITY: As an IT admin, I want dashboard widgets laid out by role and priority, so that staff see their most critical information first. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
1. GIVEN a user with an assigned role, WHEN they open mydash, THEN widgets are ordered by role-specific priority rules.
2. GIVEN an admin updates priority weights for a role, WHEN affected users next load mydash, THEN the new ordering is applied.
3. GIVEN a user lacks permission for a high-priority widget, WHEN the dashboard renders, THEN that widget is hidden and the next eligible widget takes its slot.

### role-based > individual personalisation
**demand: 562** | Category: security | **Coverage: mydash**

CAPABILITY: As an IT admin, I want role-based dashboard defaults rather than per-user personalisation, so that governance scales without bespoke configuration per employee. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
1. GIVEN an admin defines a dashboard layout for a role group, WHEN a user in that group opens MyDash, THEN they see the role's default widgets and arrangement.
2. GIVEN a user belongs to multiple role groups, WHEN they load MyDash, THEN role precedence rules resolve to a single deterministic layout shown to the user.
3. GIVEN an admin updates a role-based layout, WHEN affected users reload MyDash, THEN the new layout propagates without requiring per-user reconfiguration.

### role vs interest vs journey
**demand: 561** | Category: security | **Coverage: mydash**

CAPABILITY: As an IT admin, I want to distinguish role, interest, and journey when assigning dashboard access, so that permissions match actual responsibilities. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
1. GIVEN a user assigned a role, WHEN they open MyDash, THEN they see only widgets permitted for that role.
2. GIVEN a user expresses an interest without a matching role, WHEN they request a widget, THEN access is denied and an audit entry is logged.
3. GIVEN a user is mid-journey across multiple roles, WHEN their active role changes, THEN the dashboard re-renders with the new role's permissions within one session refresh.

## Stakeholders

(No stakeholders linked. Infer from the features and user stories above.)

## Company-Wide Architecture Rules (23 ADRs)

These rules are MANDATORY for all Conduction apps.

### ADR-001-data-layer
- ALL domain data → OpenRegister objects. NO custom Entity/Mapper for domain data.
- App config → `IAppConfig`. NOT OpenRegister.
- Cross-entity references: OpenRegister relations (register+schema+objectId). NO foreign keys.
  MUST NOT store foreign keys or embed full objects.

### Schema standards

- Schemas: PascalCase, schema.org vocabulary, explicit types + required flags + description field.
- MUST NOT invent custom property names when a schema.org equivalent exists.
- Contact schemas MUST align with vCard properties (fn, email, tel, adr).
- Dutch government fields SHOULD use a mapping layer translating between international standards
  and Dutch specs — do not hardcode Dutch field names as primary.
- Schema changes that remove or rename properties are BREAKING. Adding optional properties is non-breaking.

### Register templates

- Location: `lib/Settings/{app}_register.json` (OpenAPI 3.0 + `x-openregister` extensions).
- Three template categories:
  - **App configuration** — define data models (schemas/registers/views/mappings).
    Mark with `x-openregister.type: "application"`.
  - **Mock data** — fictional but realistic seed data for dev/test.
    Mark with `x-openregister.type: "mock"`.
  - **Government standards** — aligned to Dutch API specs (BAG, BRP, KVK, DSO).
- Import mechanism: `ConfigurationService::importFromApp(appId, data, version, force)` →
  `ImportHandler::importFromApp()`. Called from repair step or `SettingsLoadService`.
- Idempotency: re-importing with `force: false` MUST NOT create duplicates. Match by slug
  using `ObjectService::searchObjects` with `_rbac: false` and `_multitenancy: false`.
  Use `version_compare` for skip logic.

### Seed data

Apps that store data in OpenRegister are empty on first install. An empty app cannot be
meaningfully tested — there are no objects to view, search, filter, or interact with.
This blocks both automated browser testing and manual QA. The Loadable Register Template
pattern (see Register templates above) already supports seed data via `components.objects[]`
with the `@self` envelope.

**Requirements:**

- Every app using OpenRegister MUST include 3-5 realistic objects per schema in
  `lib/Settings/{app}_register.json`.
- Use `@self` envelope: `{ "@self": { "register": ..., "schema": ..., "slug": ... }, ...properties }`.
  Register/schema MUST match keys; slug is unique human-readable identifier for matching.
- Use general organisation data (municipality, consultancy, travel agency, non-profit) —
  NOT context-specific. Varied, realistic field values.
- Mock data quality: real Dutch street names, valid postcodes (`[1-9][0-9]{3}[A-Z]{2}`),
  correct municipality/KVK codes, BSNs that pass 11-proef. Fictional but distinguishable from real.
- Cross-register consistency: BRP→BAG, KVK→BAG, DSO→BAG references must be valid.
- Loaded on install alongside schemas via same `importFromApp()` pipeline.
- MUST be idempotent — re-importing skips existing objects matched by slug.

**In OpenSpec artifacts:**

- **In design.md**: MUST include a Seed Data section when change introduces/modifies schemas —
  define seed objects per schema with concrete field values and related items (files, notes, tasks, contacts).
- **In tasks.md**: MUST include a seed data generation task when change introduces/modifies schemas.

**Exceptions** (no seed data required):

- **nldesign** — has no OpenRegister schemas.
- **ExApp sidecar wrappers** (openklant, opentalk, openzaak, valtimo, n8n-nextcloud) — proxy
  external services and do not use OpenRegister.
- **nextcloud-vue** — shared library, no seed data applicable.
- Changes that only modify frontend components or non-schema backend logic (e.g., settings,
  permissions) do not require seed data.

**Limitations:** OpenRegister's `ImportHandler` currently supports only flat seed objects.
Related items (files, notes, tasks, contacts) linked through the relation system are tracked
on the product roadmap. Until then, seed data is limited to object properties defined in schemas.

### Deduplication check

- Before proposing new capability: search `openspec/specs/` and `openregister/lib/Service/` for overlap
  with ObjectService, RegisterService, SchemaService, ConfigurationService, and shared Vue components.
- If similar capability exists: MUST reference it and explain why new code is needed rather than extending.
- Proposals duplicating existing functionality without justification MUST be rejected.
- **In design.md**: MUST include a "Reuse Analysis" section listing existing OpenRegister services leveraged.
- **In tasks.md**: MUST include a "Deduplication Check" task verifying no overlap — document findings
  even if "no overlap found".

### Schema migrations

- Breaking schema changes → new migration in repair step. NEVER modify existing migrations.

### OpenRegister + @conduction/nextcloud-vue — DO NOT REBUILD

### What apps SHOULD build (custom business logic only):
- External API integrations (SAP, Peppol, TenderNed, etc.)
- PDF/document generation with business-specific templates
- Workflow triggers and business rules specific to the domain
- Notification dispatch with app-specific event types
- Custom settings pages with app-specific configuration
- Background jobs for domain-specific processing

### ADR-002-api
- URL pattern: `/index.php/apps/{app}/api/{resource}` — lowercase plural, hyphens.
- Methods: GET=read, POST=create, PUT=update, DELETE=remove. No custom methods.
- Pagination: support `_page` + `_limit`. Response includes `total`, `page`, `pages`.
- Errors: appropriate HTTP status + `message` field. NO stack traces in responses.
- Auth: Nextcloud built-in only. NO custom login/session/token flows.
- Public endpoints: annotate `#[PublicPage]` + `#[NoCSRFRequired]`. Register CORS OPTIONS route.

### ADR-003-backend
- **Controller → Service → Mapper** (strict 3-layer). Controllers NEVER call mappers directly.
- Controllers: thin (<10 lines/method). Routing + validation + response only.
- Services: ALL business logic. Stateless — no instance state between requests.
- Mappers: DB CRUD only. No business logic.
- DI: constructor injection with `private readonly`. NO `\OC::$server` or static locators.
- Entity setters: POSITIONAL args only. `$e->setName('val')` — NEVER `$e->setName(name: 'val')`.
  (`__call` passes `['name' => val]` but `setter()` uses `$args[0]`.)
- Routes: `appinfo/routes.php`. Specific routes BEFORE wildcard `{slug}` routes.
- Config: `IAppConfig` with sensitive flag for secrets. NEVER read DB directly.
- Lifecycle: schema init via repair steps (`IRepairStep`), background via job queue, events via dispatcher.
- **Spec traceability**: every class and public method MUST have `@spec` PHPDoc tag(s) linking to
  the OpenSpec change that caused it: `@spec openspec/changes/{name}/tasks.md#task-N`.
  Multiple `@spec` tags allowed (code touched by multiple changes). File-level `@spec` in header docblock.
  This enables: code → docblock → spec traceability alongside code → git blame → commit → issue → spec.

### ADR-004-frontend
- **Vue 2 + Pinia + @nextcloud/vue + @conduction/nextcloud-vue**. NO Vuex. Options API only.
- State: Pinia stores in `src/store/modules/`. Use `createObjectStore` for OpenRegister CRUD.
- API calls: `axios` from `@nextcloud/axios` — auto-attaches CSRF token. NEVER raw `fetch()` for mutations.
  Loading state with `try/finally`.
- Translations: ALL user-visible strings via `t(appName, 'text')`. NO hardcoded strings.
  Translation keys MUST be English — Dutch translations go in `l10n/nl.json`.
- CSS: ONLY Nextcloud CSS variables (`var(--color-primary-element)`, etc.). NO hardcoded colors.
  NEVER reference `--nldesign-*` directly — nldesign app handles theming.
- Router: history mode, base `generateUrl('/apps/{app}/')`. Requires matching PHP routes in `routes.php`.
  Deep link URL templates MUST match the router mode — use path format (`/apps/{app}/entities/{uuid}`),
  NOT hash format (`/apps/{app}/#/entities/{uuid}`).
- OpenRegister dependency: settings returns `openRegisters` (bool) + `isAdmin`.
  Show empty state if OR missing. NEVER use `OC.isAdmin` — get from backend.
- NEVER `window.confirm()` or `window.alert()` — use `NcDialog` or `CnFormDialog` (WCAG, theming).
- NEVER read app state from DOM (`document.getElementById`, `dataset`) — use backend API or store.
- EVERY `await store.action()` call MUST be wrapped in `try/catch` with user-facing error feedback.
- NEVER import from `@nextcloud/vue` directly — use `@conduction/nextcloud-vue` which re-exports all
  NC components plus Conduction components. This ensures consistent theming and component versions.
- EVERY component used in `<template>` MUST be imported AND registered in `components: {}`.
  Vue 2 silently renders unknown elements — missing imports cause invisible runtime failures.

### NL Design System

- ALL UI components MUST use CSS custom properties from NL Design System tokens.
- MUST support theme switching via nldesign app's token sets.
- MUST meet WCAG AA compliance: keyboard-navigable, associated labels, color is not the sole
  method of conveying information.
- SHOULD work on 320px–1920px viewports; critical functionality MUST work at 768px (tablet).
- Exceptions: PDF generation (docudesk), admin-only screens (simpler styling allowed).

  `formatValue()` | `buildHeaders()` | `buildQueryString()`

### Page Construction Patterns (follow these recipes)

**App.vue:** `NcContent` → 3 states: loading (`NcLoadingIcon`), no-OpenRegister (`NcEmptyContent`),
  ready (`MainMenu` + `NcAppContent` + `router-view` + optional `CnIndexSidebar`).
  Inject `sidebarState` for child components. `created()` calls `initializeStores()`.

**MainMenu:** `NcAppNavigation` with `NcAppNavigationItem` per route (icon + name + `:to`).
  Footer: `NcAppNavigationSettings` (gear foldout) with admin/config nav items.
  Settings item emits `@click="$emit('open-settings')"` — opens `NcAppSettingsDialog` modal.
  Do NOT route to `/settings` — in-app settings is a modal overlay, not a page.

**Dashboard:** `CnDashboardPage` with `CnStatsBlock` KPIs (4 cards: open/overdue/value/completed),
  status distribution chart, "My Work" list (grouped: overdue → due this week → rest).
  Fetch all collections in parallel via `Promise.all`. Widget templates via `#widget-{id}` slots.

**Index page:** `CnIndexPage` with `useListView(entityType, { sidebarState, objectStore })`.
  Inject sidebarState. Row click → `$router.push({ name: 'EntityDetail', params: { id } })`.
  Add button → new entity detail with id='new'.

**Detail page:** Two modes — edit (form component) / view (`CnDetailPage` + `CnDetailCard` sections).
  Header actions: Edit + Delete buttons. Related entities in table inside `CnDetailCard`.
  Props: `entityId` from route. `isNew = entityId === 'new'`. Sidebar via `CnObjectSidebar`.
  **Relations:** Every entity referenced in the spec MUST have a `CnDetailCard` section.
  Use `fetchUsed` for reverse lookups (find objects that reference THIS entity) and
  `fetchUses` for forward lookups (find objects THIS entity references).
  If the spec lists a "linked X section", it MUST be implemented — not deferred or stubbed.

**Settings — two surfaces, never a route:**
  *Admin settings* (`/settings/admin/{appid}`): `AdminRoot.vue` rendered by `settings.js` entry point,
  registered via `AdminSettings.php`. Layout: `CnVersionInfoCard` (FIRST) → `CnRegisterMapping` →
  `CnSettingsSection` per feature. Load via `GET /api/settings`, save via `POST /api/settings`.
  *In-app settings*: `UserSettings.vue` wrapping `NcAppSettingsDialog` — opened as a modal from the
  gear menu (`@open-settings` event on MainMenu), handled in `App.vue` with `:open` / `@update:open`.
  Do NOT create a `/settings` route. Do NOT create a standalone `SettingsView.vue` page component.

**Router:** Flat routes (no nesting), all named, props via arrow function for params.
  Routes: `/` (Dashboard), `/{entities}` (list), `/{entities}/:id` (detail).
  No `/settings` route — settings is a modal (see Settings section above).

**Store init:** `initializeStores()` in `store/store.js` — fetches settings, then calls
  `objectStore.registerObjectType(name, schemaSlug, registerSlug)` for each entity.
  Object store uses `createObjectStore` with plugins (files, auditTrails, relations).
  Settings store: Pinia `defineStore` with `fetchSettings()` and `saveSettings()`.

### ADR-005-security
- Auth: Nextcloud built-in ONLY. NO custom login, sessions, tokens, password storage.
- Admin check: `IGroupManager::isAdmin()` on BACKEND. Frontend-only checks = vulnerability.
- Per-object authorization (IDOR prevention): every mutation endpoint that operates on a specific
  object MUST check that the authenticated user owns, is in the group of, or is admin for THAT
  object — not just that they are logged in. `#[NoAdminRequired]` opens the endpoint to all users;
  without a per-object check, any user can modify any object by guessing its ID.
  Pattern: fetch object → extract `assigneeUserId`/`assigneeGroupId`/`createdBy` → check
  (owner OR in group OR admin) → throw `OCSForbiddenException` if none apply. Extract into a
  reusable `authorizeXxx(object, user)` service method, called from every PUT/POST/DELETE.
- Multi-tenant isolation: enforce at API/service level, not UI only.
- NO PII in logs, error responses, or debug output.
- Audit trails: use `$user->getUID()` — NEVER `$user->getDisplayName()` (mutable, spoofable).
- Identity: always derive from `IUserSession` on backend — NEVER trust frontend-sent user IDs or display names.
- Nextcloud endpoint defaults: NO annotation = admin-only. Non-admin endpoints (agent/staff actions)
  MUST have `#[NoAdminRequired]` attribute. Pair every `#[NoAdminRequired]` with a per-object auth
  check — never trust the session alone for mutation.
- **Auth attribute must match the method's actual requirement** (semantic consistency, not just
  syntactic presence — observed 2026-04-23 on decidesk#44 where the builder satisfied the route-
  auth gate by adding `#[NoAdminRequired]` to a method whose body calls `requireAdmin()`):
  - `#[PublicPage]` — genuinely public; body MUST NOT call `requireAdmin()`, `isAdmin()`, or
    return `Http::STATUS_UNAUTHORIZED/FORBIDDEN` conditionally. Use for login pages, OAuth
    callbacks, public manifests.
  - `#[NoAdminRequired]` — any authenticated user allowed; body MUST carry a per-object auth
    check (ADR-005 Rule 3 / `hydra-gate-no-admin-idor`). Body MUST NOT call `requireAdmin()` —
    that semantics belongs on `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting]` instead.
  - `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting(Application::APP_ID)]` — admin-only, framework-enforced at the
    middleware layer. Preferred for methods that call `requireAdmin()` / `isAdmin()` in body;
    lifts the check out of the controller into the routing table where it is declarative
    and grep-able.
  - No annotation — admin-only by Nextcloud default; prefer the explicit
    `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting]` for clarity.
  Enforcement: `hydra-gate-semantic-auth` (gate-9) catches common mismatches (`NoAdminRequired`
  + `requireAdmin()` body, `PublicPage` + body auth check). Gate-5 remains syntactic-only
  (attribute present); gate-9 is the semantic layer.
- Input validation: all user-supplied strings that flow into URLs (query params, path segments)
  MUST be URL-encoded (`encodeURIComponent` in Vue/JS, `rawurlencode` in PHP). Email Message-IDs,
  file names, and free-text fields commonly contain `<`, `>`, `/`, `@`, `&` which break unencoded.
- File uploads: validate type + size before storage.
- API responses: NO stack traces, SQL, or internal paths.
- Error messages: use static, generic messages (`'Operation failed'`, `'Not authorized'`) — NEVER
  return `$e->getMessage()` to clients. Log the real error server-side with `$this->logger->error()`.
- Test collections: NEVER commit default credentials — use env variable placeholders.

### ADR-006-metrics
- Every app: `GET /api/metrics` (Prometheus text, admin auth) + `GET /api/health` (JSON, public).
- Metric names: `{app}_` prefix. MUST include `{app}_health_status` and `{app}_info`.
- Health check MUST verify OpenRegister connectivity (for apps that depend on it).

### ADR-007-i18n
# ADR-007: Internationalization (i18n)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
All Conduction Nextcloud apps serve Dutch government users but must support multiple languages. We need a consistent approach to internationalization across all apps.

## Decision

### Primary Language: English
- **English (en) is the source/primary language** for all code and translation keys.
- All `t()` keys and `$this->l10n->t()` strings MUST be written in English.
- `l10n/en.json` is the identity-mapped source file (key == value).
- Hardcoded Dutch strings in code MUST be converted to English keys with Dutch translations in `nl.json`.

### Sentence Case for All UI Strings
- All translation keys and user-facing strings MUST use **sentence case**: only the first word is capitalized.
- Correct: `"Add directory"`, `"No results found"`, `"Delete selected"`, `"Save configuration"`
- Wrong (title case): `"Add Directory"`, `"No Results Found"`, `"Delete Selected"`
- Wrong (all lowercase): `"add directory"`, `"no results found"`
- **Exceptions** that keep their capitalization:
  - Proper nouns and product names: `"OpenRegister"`, `"Nextcloud"`, `"GitHub"`, `"DocuDesk"`
  - Acronyms: `"API"`, `"URL"`, `"PDF"`, `"SOLR"`, `"JSON"`, `"RBAC"`, `"OAS"`
  - Single-word strings still start with a capital: `"Delete"`, `"Search"`, `"Save"`

### Required Languages
- Minimum: English (en) + Dutch (nl) translations.
- `l10n/en.json` and `l10n/nl.json` MUST exist in every app with a UI.
- Both files MUST contain exactly the same keys, with zero gaps.

### Frontend Translation
- JS: `t(appName, 'key')` for singular, `n(appName, 'singular', 'plural', count)` for plurals.
- `Vue.mixin({ methods: { t, n } })` for Options API components.
- `<script setup>` components MUST import `t` directly from `@nextcloud/l10n` (mixin does not apply).

### Backend Translation
- PHP: `$this->l10n->t('key')` for user-facing messages in JSONResponse.
- Controllers returning user-facing messages MUST inject `OCP\IL10N`.
- Log messages, internal exceptions, and database values are NOT translated.

### API and Data
- API field names: always English (language-neutral data layer).
- Date/number formatting: respect user locale via Nextcloud core.
- Each app with OpenRegister: define `register-i18n` spec listing translatable fields.

### Shared Component Library (@conduction/nextcloud-vue)
- The shared library does NOT translate internally — it accepts pre-translated strings via props.
- Components have English defaults for all label/text props (e.g., `addLabel="Add"`, `cancelLabel="Cancel"`).
- Consumer apps are responsible for passing `t()` results as prop values.
- The library lists `@nextcloud/l10n` as a peer dependency, not a direct dependency.

## Consequences
- All apps maintain two translation files that must stay in sync.
- Dutch strings used as translation keys (e.g., `t('app', 'Besluiten')`) are a violation — the English equivalent must be the key.
- Title case in translation keys (e.g., `"Add Directory"`) is a violation — use sentence case (`"Add directory"`).
- New features must include both `en.json` and `nl.json` entries before merging.

### ADR-008-testing
- Every new PHP service/controller → PHPUnit tests in `tests/Unit/` (≥3 methods).
- Every new Vue component → test file (if test framework exists).
- Every new API endpoint → Newman/Postman collection in `tests/integration/`.
- Every spec scenario → browser test (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN verified via Playwright).
- All tests MUST pass in `composer check:strict`.
- Integration tests MUST cover error paths (403, 401, 400) — not just happy path (200).
- Test collections: use env variable placeholders for credentials — NEVER hardcode defaults.

### Smoke testing (before opening PR)

After implementing, verify your code actually works — quality gates catch lint/types, not logic:

1. Call each new API endpoint with `curl` — verify response shape and status code
2. Test at least one error path per endpoint (missing param, wrong auth, invalid input)
3. If the spec says a feature is deferred, verify it is NOT registered/enabled
4. If tasks.md marks a task `[x]`, verify it is fully implemented — not a stub or TODO

### Task completeness verification

Before marking a task `[x]` in tasks.md or opening a PR:
- Re-read every task in tasks.md
- For each `[x]` task, verify the implementation exists AND works — not a placeholder
- Stub components, empty relation sections, and TODO comments are NOT complete
- If a task cannot be completed, leave it `[ ]` and explain in the PR description

### ADR-009-docs
- Every user-facing feature → docs in `docs/` with screenshots from running app.
- English primary, Dutch recommended. Update docs when behavior changes.

### ADR-010-nl-design
- ALL UI: CSS custom properties from NL Design System tokens. NO hardcoded colors, fonts, spacing.
- Theme switching: support `nldesign` app's token sets (Rijkshuisstijl, Utrecht, municipality-specific).
- Components: `@nextcloud/vue` primary. Custom components styled via NL Design tokens only.
- Scoped styles: ALL `<style>` blocks MUST use `scoped` attribute.
- WCAG AA mandatory: keyboard-navigable, labelled forms, color not sole conveyor, alt text on images.
- Responsive: work from 320px to 1920px. Critical features accessible at 768px.
- Specs: reference token names ("primary action color") NOT hex values. Include a11y verification in ACs.
- Exception: PDF generation (docudesk) may use fixed dimensions. Admin screens MAY simplify but MUST meet WCAG AA.

### ADR-011-schema-standards
- schema.org types/properties as primary vocabulary (`schema:Person`, `schema:Organization`, `schema:Event`).
- Contact schemas: align with vCard properties (`fn`, `email`, `tel`, `adr`).
- Dutch government fields: mapping layer translating between international standards and Dutch APIs (VNG, ZGW).
- NO custom property names when schema.org equivalent exists.
- Relations: OpenRegister relation mechanism (register + schema + objectId). NO foreign keys or embedded objects.
- Versioning: removing/renaming properties = BREAKING → migration via repair step. Adding optional = non-breaking.
- Specs MUST define data models using schema.org vocabulary; design docs MUST include schema definitions with types, required flags, relations.
- Exception: app-specific workflow states (pipeline stages, process statuses) MAY use custom vocabularies.

### ADR-012-deduplication
- Before proposing new capability: search OpenRegister specs + services for overlap. Reference + justify if similar exists.
- Design docs MUST include "Reuse Analysis" listing which OpenRegister services are leveraged.
- If logic could benefit other apps → propose adding to OpenRegister core, not app-specific.
- Tasks MUST include "Deduplication Check" verifying no overlap with:
  ObjectService, RegisterService, SchemaService, ConfigurationService, shared specs, @conduction/nextcloud-vue.
- Document findings even if "no overlap found".
- Exception: OpenRegister checks internal duplication only. nldesign checks token sets. nextcloud-vue checks own components.

### ADR-013-container-pool
# ADR-013: Unified Container Pool

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-04-12

## Context

Specter (intelligence/research) and Hydra (build/review/merge) both run LLM workloads in Docker containers. Today they operate independently: Hydra spins up builder/reviewer/security containers on demand, Specter has a separate `run_llm_containers.sh` wrapper. Both compete for the same Claude Max rate limits.

We want to unify these into a **single priority-scheduled container pool** so that:
- Critical work (bugfixes, reviews) preempts lower-priority work (discovery, research)
- A fixed number of containers (e.g. 10) run continuously, pulling from a shared queue
- Token rotation and rate limit recovery happen at the pool level, not per-script
- Adding a new workload type (audit, spec generation, test) is just a new queue entry

## Decision

### Container types (priority order)

| Priority | Type | Source | Container image | Model | Fallback |
|----------|------|--------|-----------------|-------|----------|
| 1 | **code-review** | Hydra: PR code review + in-container fixes | `hydra-reviewer` | sonnet | opus |
| 2 | **security-review** | Hydra: PR security review + in-container fixes | `hydra-security` | sonnet | opus |
| 3 | **applier** | Hydra: binary go/no-go gate (no fix authority) | `hydra-applier` | sonnet | opus |
| 4 | **build** | Hydra: initial spec build | `hydra-builder` | haiku | — |
| 5 | **audit** | Hydra: codebase audit | `hydra-builder` | sonnet | opus |
| 6 | **spec-generation** | Specter: push_spec_pipeline | `specter-llm-worker` | sonnet | haiku |
| 7 | **schema-synthesis** | Specter: generate/dedup schemas | `specter-llm-worker` | haiku | — |
| 8 | **classification** | Specter: classify/redistribute features | `specter-llm-worker` | haiku | — |
| 9 | **translation** | Specter: translate requirements | `specter-llm-worker` | haiku | — |
| 10 | **discovery** | Specter: research, feature extraction | `specter-llm-worker` | haiku | — |

**No-loop policy (openspec/changes/no-loop-review-pipeline):** Reviewers own fix
authority. The Applier is a read-only final gate that emits a binary pass/fail
verdict — it never modifies files. Every post-review outcome is terminal:
merge (on `applier:pass` or reviews passed with zero fixes) or `needs-input`
(on `applier:fail`, reviewer `agent-maxed-out`, or post-review deterministic
check failure). There is no fix-iteration loop and no `bugfix` container.

### Model strategy

**Principle:** Use the cheapest model that can do the job. Reserve expensive models for judgment work.

| Work type | Model | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Build (implementation) | **Haiku** | Clear instructions (tasks.md, design.md). Pattern-following, not judgment. Faster and cheaper — 5 parallel Haiku builds burn far less quota than Sonnet. |
| Fix-quality / fix-browser (pre-review) | **Haiku** | "Fix this PHPCS error" or "fix this browser test failure" — explicit, targeted corrections triggered by deterministic check output during the build phase. |
| Code review (+ in-container fix authority) | **Sonnet → Opus** | Judgment + bounded fixes. Sonnet is the primary; falls back to Opus when Sonnet quota exhausted. Budget: 40 turns (up from 20) to cover review + self-verified fixes. |
| Security review (+ in-container fix authority in PR mode) | **Sonnet → Opus** | Critical: injection vectors, auth bypasses, secret leaks. Same fallback logic. Budget: 40 turns in PR mode, 120 in full-audit mode (audit mode has no fix authority). |
| Applier (Axel Pliér) | **Sonnet → Opus** | Final binary go/no-go. No fix tools. Reads hydra.json + PR state + ADRs, emits `{pass, blocking[]}`. Budget: 20 turns. |
| Audit | **Sonnet → Opus** | Full codebase analysis — needs depth. |

**Quota optimization:** Claude Max plans have separate "Sonnet only" and "all models" weekly limits. By defaulting builders to Haiku, the Sonnet quota is reserved for reviews only (~20 turns each, 2 per PR). When Sonnet runs out, reviews fall back to the **deeper** model (Opus), not the shallower one — because reviews are the last line of defense before human approval.

**Overrides:** Set `HYDRA_BUILDER_MODEL`, `HYDRA_REVIEWER_MODEL`, or `HYDRA_REVIEWER_FALLBACK_MODEL` env vars to change defaults.

### Queue table (future)

```sql
CREATE TABLE container_queue (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,        -- bugfix, code-review, build, classify, etc.
    priority INTEGER NOT NULL,         -- 1=highest
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,            -- script args, spec slug, issue URL, etc.
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, running, completed, failed
    container_id VARCHAR(100),         -- docker container name when running
    token_account VARCHAR(50),         -- which OAuth account is assigned
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,
    exit_code INTEGER,
    error_message TEXT
);
```

### Phased rollout

**Phase 1 (now):** All LLM calls containerized. Specter scripts run via `run_llm_containers.sh`. Hydra containers use `run_container_with_fallback`. Both read from `credentials.json`. No shared queue yet — each system schedules its own containers.

**Phase 2:** Shared queue table. A single scheduler script replaces both `cron-hydra.sh` dispatch and `run_llm_containers.sh`. Pool size configurable. Priority enforcement by not starting low-prio work when high-prio is queued.

**Phase 3:** Preemption. Running low-priority containers can be stopped (gracefully, with checkpoint) when high-priority work arrives and all slots are occupied. Container images support checkpoint/resume via DB state.

### Current state (Phase 1)

**Container images:**

| Image | Size | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `conduction/nextcloud-test:stable31` | 1.5GB | Prebuild NC server + PostgreSQL + OpenRegister (cloned) |
| `hydra-builder:latest` | 1.9GB | Code implementation: NC test env + Claude CLI + PHP + skills |
| `hydra-reviewer:latest` | 1.3GB | Code review + bounded in-container fix authority (Juan Claude van Damme) |
| `hydra-security:latest` | 1.9GB | Security review + bounded in-container fix authority (Clyde Barcode) |
| `hydra-applier:latest` | 1.0GB | Binary go/no-go gate; no Write/Edit tools (Axel Pliér) |
| `specter-spec-writer:latest` | ~800MB | Spec generation: Claude CLI + openspec CLI + skills (no PHP) |
| `specter-llm-worker:latest` | ~500MB | Intelligence pipeline: Claude CLI + DB access |

**Credential separation:**
- **Specter:** `concurrentie-analyse/secrets/credentials.json` (work + private tokens)
- **Hydra:** `hydra/secrets/credentials.json` (work token only)

**Token detection:**
- Container mode: uses exit code (0 = success, non-zero checks output for rate limit)
- Local mode: checks output text for "rate limit" / "auth failed" strings

**NC test environment:**
- Prebuild image with PostgreSQL (matches production, not SQLite)
- Builder `COPY --from=conduction/nextcloud-test` at build time
- Entrypoint starts PG + enables OpenRegister at runtime
- Each container gets its own isolated NC+PG instance

**Spec generation flow:**
- `push_spec_pipeline.py` prepares repos in parallel, generates in `specter-spec-writer` containers
- Each spec gets its own container + clone (compartmentalized)
- Dependency tiers control ordering: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
- Specs with met deps push to development directly (doc-only merge guard)
- Issues created with `yolo` label → Hydra auto-builds, reviews, merges, closes issue

### Container capability profiles

Each container persona runs with a different Linux capability set determined by the trust we extend to it. This is load-bearing for runtime behaviour — a container's `/workspace` is ONLY writable by the claude user if the build or the entrypoint arranges it, and the two code paths diverge based on cap profile.

| Persona | Caps added | Claude user | Workspace setup |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Builder | SETUID, SETGID, DAC_OVERRIDE, CHOWN, FOWNER | Dropped via `gosu` at run time | Entrypoint chowns at start, relies on DAC_OVERRIDE |
| Reviewer | SETUID, SETGID, DAC_OVERRIDE, CHOWN, FOWNER | Same as builder | Same — entrypoint chown |
| Security | SETUID, SETGID, DAC_OVERRIDE, CHOWN, FOWNER | Same | Same |
| **Applier** | **None** (minimum-cap — read-only judge) | **Runs as `claude:claude` via `docker --user`** (no gosu drop possible — can't setuid without SETUID) | **Must be pre-chowned at IMAGE BUILD TIME** — no runtime chown possible |

**The applier's minimum-cap profile has a hard consequence:** its Dockerfile MUST contain
```dockerfile
RUN mkdir -p /workspace && chown claude:claude /workspace && chmod 0775 /workspace
```
before the `WORKDIR /workspace` directive. Otherwise the non-root claude user cannot write files into its own workdir, `hydra_prefetch_pr_context` silently fails every redirect, Claude runs 0 turns, and the orchestrator records `pass=null, turns=0 → applier:fail`. Observed on decidesk#44 2026-04-23 06:01 UTC — looked like a harness bug, real cause was one missing `chown` line in the Dockerfile.

This is **the rule for any future minimum-cap persona**: if you drop DAC_OVERRIDE + SETUID for security reasons, the Dockerfile owns workspace ownership — the entrypoint cannot.

## Consequences

- All LLM calls go through containers — no direct `claude -p` from host scripts
- Token management is centralized per system (Specter has private fallback, Hydra doesn't)
- Container exit code determines token rotation (not mid-session JSONL text)
- Prebuild NC image eliminates 30-60s clone overhead per builder container
- Container images are the unit of deployment — version, test, rollback independently
- ADR-000 convention: every repo's data model is at `openspec/architecture/adr-000-data-model.md`
- `context-brief.md` in each change directory carries intelligence data through the full pipeline
- Minimum-cap containers (applier) require Dockerfile-time workspace chown; higher-cap containers can chown at runtime. This split is permanent — don't ship a new minimum-cap persona without pre-chowning.

### ADR-014-licensing
- Licence: EUPL-1.2 (European Union Public Licence).
- `appinfo/info.xml`: MUST use `<licence>agpl</licence>` — Nextcloud app store does not recognise EUPL.
- This is intentional dual-tagging, NOT a conflict. Do NOT change info.xml to eupl. Do NOT flag as review finding.

## PHP files — PHPDoc tags only

License and copyright metadata on PHP files lives **only** in the main file docblock as PHPDoc tags:

```php
<?php

/**
 * Short Description
 *
 * Longer description.
 *
 * @category Controller
 * @package  OCA\{AppName}\Controller
 *
 * @author    Conduction Development Team <info@conduction.nl>
 * @copyright 2026 Conduction B.V.
 * @license   EUPL-1.2 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/eupl-text-eupl-12
 *
 * @link https://conduction.nl
 *
 * @spec openspec/changes/{change-name}/tasks.md#task-N
 */

declare(strict_types=1);
```

**Required tags on every PHP file:** `@author`, `@copyright`, `@license`, `@link`, `@spec`. File-level `@spec` links back to the OpenSpec change that created or last modified the file (ADR-003). Classes and public methods also carry their own `@spec` tag.

**Do NOT add:**
- `SPDX-FileCopyrightText: ...` lines in the docblock — that duplicates `@copyright`.
- `SPDX-License-Identifier: ...` lines in the docblock — that duplicates `@license`.
- `// SPDX-*` line comments before or after the docblock.

## Vue / JS / CSS files

These file types don't carry PHPDoc. Use SPDX header as the first line:

- Vue: `<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: EUPL-1.2 -->`
- JS / TS: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: EUPL-1.2`
- CSS / SCSS: `/* SPDX-License-Identifier: EUPL-1.2 */`

## Repo-level REUSE compliance

Every app repo SHOULD carry a `REUSE.toml` at its root declaring license + copyright for every file pattern. This is the authoritative source for REUSE compliance — `reuse lint` reads it instead of requiring per-file SPDX headers for PHP files:

```toml
version = 1

[[annotations]]
path = "**/*.php"
SPDX-FileCopyrightText = "2026 Conduction B.V. <info@conduction.nl>"
SPDX-License-Identifier = "EUPL-1.2"
```

## Hydra quality gate

`scripts/run-quality.sh`'s `spdx-headers` gate enforces: every `lib/**/*.php` file has both `@license` and `@copyright` PHPDoc tags. Missing either fails the gate.

### ADR-015-common-patterns
- Common Conduction patterns. These apply to ALL apps. Every item below was found 3+ times
  across multiple code reviews. Get these right during implementation — not after review.
- When fixing any pattern violation, ALWAYS generalize: grep for the same issue across ALL
  files and fix every instance in one pass. Fixing one file while leaving the same issue in
  nine others guarantees another review round.

### OpenRegister ObjectService API
- `findObject($register, $schema, $id)` — 3 positional args, register first
- `findObjects($register, $schema, $params)` — 3 positional args, $params is filter array
- `saveObject($register, $schema, $object)` — 3 positional args, $object is array
- NEVER `getObject($id)` or `saveObject($data)` — those 1-arg signatures do not exist
- When unsure, check the OpenRegister source or existing app code

### Store registration (Vue/Pinia)
- Register each entity type ONCE in `src/store/store.js` via `createObjectStore`
- NEVER register in both `OBJECT_TYPES` and `ENTITY_STORES` — pick one pattern
- Type names: kebab-case (`action-item`), NOT camelCase (`actionItem`)
- Use platform `createObjectStore` — do NOT build custom stores (hand-rolled object.js)

### Authorization enforcement
- ALL mutation endpoints MUST have `IGroupManager::isAdmin()` check on backend
- Settings endpoints: `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting]` or `@RequireAdmin` annotation
- NEVER rely on frontend-only auth — always enforce on backend
- User identity: derive from `IUserSession` — NEVER trust frontend-sent user IDs
- Null dependency checks: throw 503, do NOT silently return empty response

### Error responses
- NEVER return `$e->getMessage()` to API — use static, generic error messages
- Pattern: `catch (\Throwable $e) { return new JSONResponse(['message' => 'Operation failed'], 500); }`
- Log the real error: `$this->logger->error('Context', ['exception' => $e]);`
- Frontend: EVERY `await store.action()` MUST be in `try/catch` with user feedback

### API calls & CSRF
- Use `axios` from `@nextcloud/axios` for ALL API calls — it auto-attaches the CSRF token
- NEVER use raw `fetch()` for mutations — missing requesttoken causes silent 403 failures
- Pattern: `import axios from '@nextcloud/axios'` + `const { data } = await axios.post(url, payload)`

### Vue component imports
- NEVER import from `@nextcloud/vue` directly — use `@conduction/nextcloud-vue` which re-exports everything
- EVERY component used in `<template>` MUST be imported AND listed in `components: {}`
- Vue 2 silently renders unknown elements — a missing import = invisible runtime failure
- Pre-commit check: for every `<NcFoo>` or `<CnFoo>` in template, verify the import exists

### SPDX headers (see also ADR-014)
- EVERY new file needs an SPDX header — apply to ALL new files in one pass
- PHP: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: EUPL-1.2` after `<?php`
- Vue: `<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: EUPL-1.2 -->` as first line
- JS: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: EUPL-1.2` as first line

### Dependency management
- When importing from a package, verify it exists in `package.json` before committing
- `@nextcloud/auth` for `getRequestToken()` — add to dependencies if missing
- Run `npm ci && npm run lint` to catch `n/no-extraneous-import` BEFORE pushing

### Translations (i18n)
- ALL user-visible strings: `this.t('appid', 'text')` in Vue, `$this->l->t('text')` in PHP
- NEVER hardcode Dutch or English strings in templates, CSV headers, or notifications
- NEVER bare `t()` in Vue — always `this.t()` (Options API)

### Data patterns
- Relations: verify `fetchUsed` vs `fetchUses` direction — wrong direction = empty cards
- Lifecycle: use the service's `transitionLifecycle()` — NEVER `saveObject()` directly for status
- Pagination: `_limit: 999` silently undercounts — use proper pagination or document the cap

### Nextcloud UI patterns
- NEVER `window.confirm()` or `window.alert()` — use `NcDialog` or `CnFormDialog`
- NEVER read app state from DOM (`document.getElementById`, `dataset`) — use backend API
- Audit trails: use `$user->getUID()` — NEVER `$user->getDisplayName()` (mutable, spoofable)
- Deferred features: if spec says "defer to phase N", do NOT register/enable them in info.xml or anywhere else
- Router: history mode with `generateUrl` base (see ADR-004). Deep link URLs must use path format, NOT hash format.
- Relations: `fetchUsed` = reverse lookup (who references me), `fetchUses` = forward lookup (what do I reference)
- Detail views: every spec-required "linked X section" MUST have a `CnDetailCard` — never stub or omit

### Pre-commit verification (run before EVERY commit)

Before committing, verify your code against these patterns:

1. **SPDX headers**: `grep -rL 'SPDX-License-Identifier' src/ lib/ --include='*.php' --include='*.vue' --include='*.js'`
   → Add headers to EVERY file missing one — all of them, not just one.
2. **ObjectService calls**: `grep -rn 'findObject\|saveObject\|findObjects' lib/ --include='*.php'`
   → Verify every call has 3 positional args: `($register, $schema, $idOrParams)`
3. **Error responses**: `grep -rn 'getMessage()' lib/Controller/ --include='*.php'`
   → Replace any `$e->getMessage()` in JSONResponse with a static error string
4. **Auth checks**: For every POST/PUT/DELETE controller method, verify `IGroupManager::isAdmin()` is called
5. **Store registration**: `grep -rn 'registerObjectType\|OBJECT_TYPES\|ENTITY_STORES' src/`
   → Verify each entity registered exactly once, kebab-case names
6. **Dependencies**: `npm run lint` — catches missing package.json entries
7. **Translations**: `grep -rn "'" src/ --include='*.vue' | grep -v "this\.t\|import\|//\|console"` — scan for hardcoded strings
8. **try/catch**: `grep -rn 'await.*Store\.' src/ --include='*.vue'` — verify every store call is wrapped
9. **No raw fetch**: `grep -rn 'fetch(' src/ --include='*.vue' --include='*.js'` — must use `@nextcloud/axios`, not raw fetch (CSRF)
10. **Import source**: `grep -rn "from '@nextcloud/vue'" src/` — must be zero matches. Use `@conduction/nextcloud-vue` instead.
11. **Component imports**: for every `<NcFoo>` or `<CnFoo>` in templates, verify the component is imported AND in `components: {}`
12. **Type slug consistency**: verify every entity type string across ALL files (store, search, routes, views) uses the same kebab-case slug — `grep -rn "agendaItem\|governanceBody\|actionItem" src/` should return zero matches
13. **Translation keys**: `grep -rn "t('.*'," src/ --include='*.vue' --include='*.js'` — verify ALL t() keys are English, not Dutch. Dutch translations go in `l10n/nl.json`.
14. **Route consistency**: verify every entity type referenced in search, navigation, or links has a matching named route in `src/router/`
15. **Task completeness**: re-read tasks.md — every `[x]` task must be fully implemented, not a stub

If ANY check fails, fix ALL instances (not just the first one) before committing.

### ADR-016-routes
- Routes: `appinfo/routes.php` is the ONLY registration path. NO runtime-registered routes, NO route
  fragments in `info.xml`, NO bootstrapped route providers added from `Application::register()`.
- `info.xml` is app metadata only (name, version, dependencies, categories, screenshots). It must
  never carry `<route>` / `<navigation>` entries that map URLs to controllers.
- Every route entry names `controller#method` explicitly — no wildcard auto-discovery, no regex
  generators. Snake_case controller maps to CamelCase class: `meeting#public_state` →
  `MeetingController::publicState()`. Lowering discoverability is the point: grepping `routes.php`
  returns the full URL surface area of the app.
- Admin settings pages: register the settings section via `\OCP\Settings\ISection` in
  `Application::register()`, but the settings URL itself is a standard `appinfo/routes.php` entry
  pointing at a controller method marked with `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting(Application::APP_ID)]`.
- Public (unauthenticated) endpoints: declare `#[PublicPage]` + `#[NoCSRFRequired]` on the method,
  and keep the route in `appinfo/routes.php` — do not invent a separate public-routes file.
- Rationale: the mechanical gates (`hydra-gate-route-auth`) scan `appinfo/routes.php` only. Every
  endpoint living there gets its auth attribute verified; an endpoint registered elsewhere
  bypasses the gate and can ship to production without its middleware posture checked. One file,
  one gate, no drift.
- Gate layering: `hydra-gate-route-auth` (gate-5) is **syntactic** — it verifies the method
  carries any of the four valid auth attributes (`#[PublicPage]` / `#[NoAdminRequired]` /
  `#[NoCSRFRequired]` / `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting]`). It does NOT check that the chosen attribute
  matches the method's actual requirement. The **semantic** layer is `hydra-gate-semantic-auth`
  (gate-9) which enforces attribute-to-body consistency per ADR-005. Both gates must pass —
  syntactic alone produces the "minimum-to-clear-the-gate" anti-pattern where a builder adds
  the cheapest attribute (`#[NoAdminRequired]`) to a method whose body calls `requireAdmin()`
  just to pass gate-5. See ADR-005 for the full attribute-to-body mapping.
- Migration: any app with routes declared in `info.xml` or injected via `Application::boot()` must
  move them to `appinfo/routes.php` before the next build — the gate treats such endpoints as
  absent, and any related controller method without an auth attribute will surface as a FAIL.

### ADR-017-component-composition
# ADR-017: Component Composition Rules

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-04-14

## Context

Conduction apps share a Vue component library (`@conduction/nextcloud-vue`) that provides self-contained, higher-level components like `CnObjectDataWidget`, `CnStatsPanel`, `CnDetailPage`, and `CnTimelineStages`. These components internally render their own card wrappers (`CnDetailCard`), headers, and layout containers.

Developers have been wrapping these self-contained components inside additional layout containers (e.g. `CnDetailCard` wrapping `CnObjectDataWidget`), producing a "card-in-card" visual artifact where headers and borders are doubled. This was found across Procest, Pipelinq, and earlier OpenCatalogi iterations.

The same principle applies to `CnDetailPage` which renders its own `NcAppContent` wrapper — apps must not add another `NcAppContent` around it.

## Decision

### Self-contained components render their own container

The following components are **self-contained** and MUST NOT be wrapped in `CnDetailCard`, `NcAppContent`, or other layout containers:

| Component | Renders its own | Use directly inside |
|---|---|---|
| `CnObjectDataWidget` | `CnDetailCard` | `CnDetailPage` slot, `<div>`, or grid cell |
| `CnObjectMetadataWidget` | `CnDetailCard` | `CnDetailPage` slot, `<div>`, or grid cell |
| `CnStatsPanel` | Sections with headers | `CnDetailPage` slot or `<div>` |
| `CnDetailPage` | `NcAppContent`-level layout | Directly in `<router-view>` |
| `CnDashboardPage` | `NcAppContent`-level layout | Directly in `<router-view>` |
| `CnIndexPage` | `NcAppContent`-level layout | Directly in `<router-view>` |
| `CnTimelineStages` | Standalone timeline | Inside `CnDetailCard` or any container (no own card) |

### How to identify self-contained components

A component is self-contained if its template root is a card, panel, or page-level wrapper. Check the component source: if it starts with `<CnDetailCard>`, `<div class="cn-*-card">`, or similar, it manages its own container.

### Correct patterns

```vue
<!-- CORRECT: CnObjectDataWidget renders its own card -->
<CnObjectDataWidget
  :schema="schema"
  :object-data="data"
  title="Case Information" />

<!-- CORRECT: CnTimelineStages is NOT self-contained, wrap it -->
<CnDetailCard :title="t('app', 'Status')">
  <CnTimelineStages :stages="stages" :current-stage="current" />
</CnDetailCard>
```

### Anti-patterns

```vue
<!-- WRONG: Double card wrapping -->
<CnDetailCard :title="t('app', 'Case Information')">
  <CnObjectDataWidget :schema="schema" :object-data="data" />
</CnDetailCard>

<!-- WRONG: Double page wrapping -->
<NcAppContent>
  <CnDetailPage :title="title">...</CnDetailPage>
</NcAppContent>
```

### External sidebar pattern

Components like `CnDetailPage` that support sidebars communicate with a parent-provided `objectSidebarState` via Vue's `provide`/`inject`. The sidebar component (`CnObjectSidebar`) MUST be rendered at the `NcContent` level in `App.vue`, NOT inside `NcAppContent`:

```vue
<!-- App.vue -->
<NcContent app-name="myapp">
  <MainMenu />
  <NcAppContent>
    <router-view />
  </NcAppContent>
  <CnObjectSidebar v-if="objectSidebarState.active" ... />
</NcContent>
```

## Consequences

- Developers must check if a shared component is self-contained before wrapping it
- The component library documents which components are self-contained in their JSDoc headers
- Code reviews should flag card-in-card nesting as a pattern violation
- Existing violations should be fixed when encountered (per ADR-015 pre-existing issues rule)

### ADR-018-widget-header-actions
# ADR-018: Widget Header Actions Pattern

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2026-04-14

## Context

Card and widget components across Conduction apps need action controls (buttons, dropdowns, selects) for user interactions like changing status, adding items, or toggling views. Developers have been placing these controls inline with card content, taking up vertical space and creating inconsistent layouts.

Nextcloud's own UI pattern places actions in the title bar (top-right) of panels and sidebars. Our shared component library should enforce this same pattern so all card/widget components have a consistent location for actions.

## Decision

### All card/widget components MUST support a `header-actions` slot

Every component that renders a title bar or header MUST provide a `header-actions` slot positioned in the **top-right of the header**, inline with the title. This is the standard location for action controls.

### Standard slot name: `header-actions`

All components use the slot name `header-actions` for consistency. Components that previously used `actions` retain it for backwards compatibility but `header-actions` is the canonical name.

### Component support status

All card/widget components in `@conduction/nextcloud-vue` now support `header-actions`:

| Component | Slot name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CnDetailCard` | `header-actions` | Primary card component |
| `CnWidgetWrapper` | `header-actions` | Dashboard widget container |
| `CnObjectDataWidget` | `header-actions` | Passes through to CnDetailCard |
| `CnObjectMetadataWidget` | `header-actions` | Passes through to CnDetailCard |
| `CnStatsPanel` | `header-actions` | Added in this ADR |
| `CnSettingsCard` | `header-actions` | Added in this ADR |
| `CnConfigurationCard` | `header-actions` + `actions` (legacy) | `header-actions` added alongside existing `actions` |
| `CnVersionInfoCard` | `header-actions` + `actions` (legacy) | `header-actions` added alongside existing `actions` |

### What goes in header-actions

- Status change dropdowns / selects
- Add/create buttons
- Toggle switches (e.g. edit mode)
- Refresh buttons
- Filter controls specific to this widget

### What does NOT go in header-actions

- Save/cancel for the entire page (those belong in `CnDetailPage` `#header-actions`)
- Bulk action toolbars (those belong in `CnMassActionBar`)
- Form inputs that are part of the data being edited

### Usage pattern

```vue
<CnDetailCard :title="t('app', 'Status')">
  <template #header-actions>
    <NcSelect
      v-model="selectedStatus"
      :options="statusOptions"
      :placeholder="t('app', 'Change status...')" />
  </template>

  <!-- Card content -->
  <CnTimelineStages :stages="stages" :current-stage="current" />
</CnDetailCard>
```

### New components

When creating new card or widget components, the `header-actions` slot MUST be included from the start. The standard template pattern:

```vue
<div class="cn-my-widget__header">
  <h4 class="cn-my-widget__title">{{ title }}</h4>
  <div v-if="$slots['header-actions']" class="cn-my-widget__header-actions">
    <slot name="header-actions" />
  </div>
</div>
```

With CSS:
```css
.cn-my-widget__header {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.cn-my-widget__header-actions {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 4px;
  flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

## Consequences

- All existing card components now support `header-actions`
- New components must include this slot from creation
- Existing apps should migrate inline actions to `header-actions` when touching those files
- Code reviews should flag action controls placed in card content as a pattern violation
- The `actions` slot name in CnConfigurationCard and CnVersionInfoCard is deprecated but retained for backwards compatibility

### ADR-019-integration-registry
# ADR-019: Integration Registry Pattern

## Status
Proposed

## Date
2026-04-21

## Context

Conduction apps (OpenCatalogi, Procest, Pipelinq, MyDash, Decidesk, DocuDesk, ZaakAfhandelApp, Larpingapp, Softwarecatalog, OpenRegister itself) all consume the same set of "things linked to an object" — files, notes, tasks, calendar events, mail, contacts, deck cards, talk conversations, and an expanding catalogue of NC-ecosystem and external services.

Until now this was implemented in two rigid places:

- `OCA\OpenRegister\Service\LinkedEntityService::TYPE_COLUMN_MAP` — a hardcoded PHP constant naming the 8 supported NC entity types.
- `@conduction/nextcloud-vue::CnObjectSidebar` — a Vue component with 5 hardcoded tabs and inline imports for each.

Adding a new integration required modifying both core OR and the shared component library. External services (OpenProject, XWiki, ...) had no path at all. Of the 8 backend-supported types, only 5 had sidebar UI and only 2 had widget components — a glaring asymmetry that grew worse with every new backend integration that landed without UI.

## Decision

Adopt a **two-sided integration registry** pattern as the canonical mechanism for declaring "things that can be linked to or rendered alongside an OpenRegister object."

### The contract — one provider, three artifacts

Every integration ships a vertical slice declared via:

1. A PHP class implementing `OCA\OpenRegister\Service\Integration\IntegrationProvider` (registered via DI tag `IntegrationProvider`).
2. A frontend registration call `OCA.OpenRegister.integrations.register({ id, label, icon, tab, widget, ... })`.

The two registrations share the same `id` — backend and frontend are paired by id, not by import.

### Three-stage filter

What the user actually sees is decided by three independent filters, each with distinct ownership:

| Stage | Owner | Question |
|---|---|---|
| **Registry** | Provider author (system) | Does this integration exist + is the required NC app installed? |
| **Schema** | Schema author (data designer) | Is this integration relevant to objects of this schema? |
| **Component** | Page author (app developer) | Should this integration appear on THIS surface? |

Stage 1 is `IntegrationRegistry::getEnabled()`. Stage 2 is the schema's `configuration.linkedTypes` whitelist. Stage 3 is the rendering component's `excludeIntegrations` prop (or equivalent layout choice).

Each stage has clear ownership; debugging "why isn't X showing?" walks the three stages in order.

### Widget parity is a hard rule

Registering an integration without **both** a sidebar tab component **and** a card widget component is a CI-enforced failure. The check runs in pre-commit, repository CI, and the hydra quality gate. Tab-only or widget-only integrations are not permitted.

### Four widget surfaces with graceful fallback

Widgets render across four surfaces: `user-dashboard`, `app-dashboard`, `detail-page`, `single-entity`. A registered widget receives the `surface` as a prop and may branch internally. Optional surface-specific components (`widgetCompact`, `widgetExpanded`, `widgetEntity`) are used when present. A new surface added in the future falls back to the main `widget` — no re-registration required from existing integrations.

### External integrations route through OpenConnector

Providers may declare `getStorageStrategy() === 'external'` and reference an OpenConnector source. OR's `ExternalIntegrationRouter` handles dispatch + auth-status surfacing. OR does not own credentials — OpenConnector does. The provider declares its `authRequirements()` so OR can show a unified admin UI and surface auth status via OCS capabilities.

### Schema validator is registry-driven

`Schema::validateLinkedTypesValue()` consults `IntegrationRegistry::listIds()` rather than a hardcoded constant. New integrations are immediately valid as `linkedTypes` values without core changes.

### Reference-property auto-rendering

A new schema property marker `referenceType: <integration-id>` causes `CnFormDialog` and `CnDetailGrid` to render the matching integration's `single-entity` widget inline next to the property. The integration registry is the single source of truth for "how to render a linked thing of this type" everywhere it appears, not just in sidebars and dashboards.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Extensibility**: any Conduction app, third-party integrator, or external-service connector can add an integration without modifying OR core or `@conduction/nextcloud-vue`.
- **Consistency**: every integration is rendered the same way, with the same lifecycle, the same RBAC hooks, the same auth surface, the same parity contract.
- **Discoverability**: integrations are advertised via OCS capabilities — mobile apps, partner integrations, and other NC apps can discover what's available without proprietary endpoints.
- **Parallelism**: leaf changes (one per integration) hang off this contract and run in parallel through hydra's pool. The current backend-vs-UI asymmetry cannot recur — parity is enforced.
- **Future flexibility**: the contract is "linked thing"–shaped so `RelationsService` (object↔object) can be unified under the same registry in a future change without breaking changes.

### Negative

- **Onboarding ceremony**: adding a new integration means more files than before (provider, tab, widget, registration, spec delta, tests). Mitigated by `scripts/scaffold-integration.sh <id>` which generates the skeleton.
- **Bundle discipline**: an integration that fails to register (wrong load order, missed `register()` call) silently vanishes. Mitigated by the parity CI gate catching missing declarations pre-merge and a dev-mode warning when a backend provider has no frontend counterpart.
- **One more abstraction**: developers reading sidebar/dashboard code must understand "why isn't this just a static import?" Mitigated by the developer guide and this ADR.

### Migration risks

- **Schema `linkedTypes` referencing not-yet-registered ids**: handled — validation is permissive on read (warns but doesn't reject), strict on write only when adding.
- **External consumers of `LinkedEntityService::TYPE_COLUMN_MAP`**: the constant is private-by-convention and not documented as public API; we don't expect external consumers. It is `@deprecated` here and removed in a follow-up cleanup change once built-in providers stabilise.
- **`CnObjectSidebar` props/slots**: every existing prop and slot is preserved. Snapshot tests guard against regressions on the 5 existing tabs.

## Companion ADR

This ADR codifies the **mechanism**. A separate companion ADR — **ADR-020: Apps Consume OpenRegister Abstractions** — codifies the broader **principle**: Conduction apps hook into OpenRegister's abstractions (registers, schemas, objects, integrations, RBAC, audit, archival, ...) rather than building parallel mechanisms. ADR-020 is authored separately; ADR-019 is the first concrete instance of that principle being applied systematically.

### ADR-020-gate-scope-to-pr-diff
# ADR-020 — Mechanical gates are scoped to the PR diff, not the whole repo

## Context

Hydra's 8 mechanical gates (`scripts/run-hydra-gates.sh`) were authored as repo-wide scanners: every `lib/**.php` file was checked on every pipeline run. This made pre-existing debt in unchanged files block every new PR. Concretely, decidesk#44 / #45 bounced through `code-review:fail → security-review:fail → needs-input` multiple cycles because `lib/Controller/SettingsController.php` (not touched by either PR) had two genuine findings — missing `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting]` on `load()` and missing `STATUS_UNAUTHORIZED` guard on `index()`. The reviewer cannot fix unchanged files in bounded scope, the builder will not re-enter fix mode for someone else's debt, and the applier refuses to override reviewer-fail verdicts. Result: two genuinely-clean PRs stuck in a ping-pong for days.

The reviewer's CLAUDE.md has long instructed Claude to apply the diff scope manually, but that is (a) advisory, not enforced, and (b) wastes turns on every run.

## Decision

Every mechanical gate in `scripts/run-hydra-gates.sh` must honor the `--scope-to-diff [BASE_REF]` flag. When set, the gate iterates only over files added, copied, modified, or renamed (`--diff-filter=ACMR`) between `BASE_REF` (default `origin/development`) and `HEAD`. Inherited debt in unchanged files is documented by a full-repo cleanup PR, not enforced via review blockers on unrelated work.

All four pipeline positions that invoke gates use `--scope-to-diff`:

| Position | Invocation site | Why scope-to-diff |
|---|---|---|
| Builder Rule 0b wrapper | `images/builder/entrypoint.sh` | Builder is creating the PR; the diff is its output. |
| Code reviewer pre-flight | `images/reviewer/entrypoint.sh` | Juan reviews the PR, not the base branch. |
| Code reviewer post-flight | `images/reviewer/entrypoint.sh` | Post-flight gate fails when Juan introduces debt; inherited debt is out of scope. |
| Security reviewer pre-flight | `images/security/entrypoint.sh` | Same rationale as code review. |
| Security reviewer post-flight | `images/security/entrypoint.sh` | Same. |

The applier runs no gates directly — it consumes the reviewers' verdicts, which now reflect scope-correct findings.

Base ref is overridable via the `HYDRA_GATE_BASE_REF` env var (default `origin/development`) for repos with a different mainline.

Gate 4 (`composer-audit`) is skipped entirely when scope-to-diff is active and neither `composer.json` nor `composer.lock` is in the diff — dep vulnerabilities are unchanged if deps are unchanged. Gate 6 (`orphan-auth`) scopes the *defining* file by diff but keeps its caller grep repo-wide so a method newly-added in the PR is still validated against any legitimate same-file or cross-file caller.

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Existing debt in unchanged files no longer blocks PRs on unrelated features. The decidesk#44/#45 ping-pong is structurally impossible going forward.
- Builder, reviewer, and security all see the same scoped gate output — no more cycle-of-life where each position reads different baselines.
- Faster pipeline runs: scanning ~20 changed files instead of ~200+ repo files per gate.

**Negative**
- Inherited debt is genuinely invisible to the pipeline until it lands in a PR. Mitigation: a full-repo audit (scope-to-diff off) runs on the `ready-for-audit` label via `cron-audit.sh`, keeping the base-branch state observable.
- A PR that ONLY modifies a file lightly (e.g. renames it) may have gates pass on that file even if it has pre-existing debt. Acceptable — gates judge what the PR touched, not the file's full history.

**Deferred to Phase G.1**
- `composer check:strict` (phpcs, phpmd, psalm, phpstan) and `phpunit` / `npm run lint` are still full-repo. They run inside `composer`/`phpunit` which don't accept per-file scoping cleanly without per-tool argument passthrough. The same scoping story will land there next; for now, the reviewer's manual scope filter (`/tmp/pr-scope.txt`) remains the safety net.

## Verification

Smoke-test on decidesk PR #131 (feature/47/p2-motion-and-voting-core-t2) 2026-04-23:
- Full-repo scan: 2 FAIL (SettingsController in unchanged file)
- `--scope-to-diff --base origin/development`: ALL 8 GATES GREEN

The PR is now unblockable by unrelated debt without sacrificing gate coverage on the 19 files it actually changed.

### ADR-021-bounded-fix-scope-by-shape
# ADR-021: Reviewer bounded-fix scope is defined by change shape, not line count

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-04-23

## Context

The reviewer containers (Juan Claude van Damme for code, Clyde Barcode for security) run with bounded fix authority — they MAY apply small remediations in-container, commit, and push. The original rule in their CLAUDE.md:

> The fix is bounded to **1–3 lines in one file**.

This rule was an attempt to keep reviewers out of architectural territory. In practice it failed in two directions:

**1. Wrong-shaped for common security patterns.** A typical missing-authorization fix — add a `checkUserRole($uid, ['chair','secretary'])` block with try/catch — is 5–10 physical lines. Reviewers correctly declined to fix under the 3-line rule. On decidesk#45 (PR#129), Clyde flagged the same two auth stubs across **eight review cycles** from 2026-04-21 to 2026-04-23, each time declining as "exceeds 3-line bounded fix scope" or "architectural decision needed". The fix was literally mirroring a sibling method (`transitionLifecycle`) in the same class — zero new concepts, just apply the existing pattern. The 3-line limit turned a mechanical fix into architectural churn.

**2. Ambiguous under formatter changes.** Does "line" mean physical lines? Logical statements? With braces? A single prettier or phpcs run can convert a 3-line compact form into a 7-line expanded form and flip fix authority on or off. Reviewers should not be measuring code in a unit that formatters can redefine.

Meanwhile, genuine architectural work — new services, new schemas, new DI — IS well understood across the team. The category error was confusing "how much code changes" with "how much thinking changes".

A 10-line change that mirrors a sibling method is safer than a 2-line change that invents a new concept. We should scope by what the change touches, not by its size.

## Decision

Reviewer bounded-fix scope is defined by **change shape**, not line count. A fix is in-scope when ALL of these hold:

1. **The shape is one of:**
   - Modify an existing method body (guard clause, try/catch, validation, escape, swap unsafe call for safe one)
   - Add a new **private** helper method in the same class (no public API change)
   - Apply a pattern that **already exists in the same file or class, OR in a sibling controller/service of the same app** — mirror the precedent
   - Add a missing attribute / annotation / docblock tag
   - Swap an unsafe API for its safe counterpart (`md5` → `password_hash`, raw SQL → prepared statement, raw HTML → `htmlspecialchars`)
   - **Add a constructor parameter to inject a dependency that is already injected in a sibling controller/service of the same app** — strictly to enable a mechanical fix above (e.g. `IUserSession` → null-check → 401, `IGroupManager` → `isAdmin()` guard). The registration block in `Application.php` is updated at the same time.

2. **The change does NOT:**
   - Introduce a brand-new dependency that no sibling class in the same app already uses (first-use DI is an architectural choice — escalate)
   - Add a new service, class, interface, or route
   - Touch database schema or migrations
   - Change any public method signature visible to callers outside the class
   - Rewrite the file's top-level control flow

3. **Self-verify stays green.** Semgrep (security) or phpcs + covering phpunit (code) on the touched file produces 0 new findings.

The "sibling precedent" clause is explicit: **if a method in the same class OR in a sibling controller/service of the same app demonstrates the fix, the "architectural decision needed" escape hatch does NOT apply.** This is the clause that closes the #45 trap — the precedent in `transitionLifecycle` makes mirroring it mechanical, regardless of how many lines the mirror takes. The sibling-class extension closes the #73 trap — `MinutesVersionController`, `DecisionSearchController`, and `NotificationSubscriptionController` each lacked `IUserSession` and required a new constructor param to add auth guards, but `MinutesApprovalController` in the same app already injected it; mirroring that constructor shape is mechanical, not architectural. The bright line stays at **first-use DI** — a dependency no sibling class in the same app already uses is a genuine architectural choice and still escalates.

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Auth-guard mirroring is now in-scope for reviewers — the most common security-fix pattern stops escalating.
- Scope is robust under formatter changes: `htmlspecialchars($val, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` on one line or three lines is the same fix.
- The "architectural" label is reserved for genuine architectural work (new services, new roles, new DI) where a human really does need to decide something.
- Fewer `needs-input` escalations on recurring findings — fewer retry cycles — less pipeline capacity burned per PR.

**Negative**
- Reviewers have slightly more scope and therefore slightly more room to make wrong calls. Mitigations:
  - The self-verify gate (Semgrep / phpcs + phpunit green on the touched file) is unchanged — still a hard stop on regressions.
  - "No new DI / schema / public signature" is a bright line that protects the expensive classes of change.
  - "Pattern exists in same file/class" is conservative — it prevents invention, only permits mirroring.
- Reviewers now need to read adjacent methods in the same class to check for precedent. This is a small turn-count cost but produces strictly better fixes.

**Neutral**
- Line-count as a heuristic is abandoned. Reviewers still prefer small fixes over large ones — the shape rules make that natural without encoding a brittle number.

## Implementation

Applied to:
- `images/reviewer/CLAUDE.md` — the "Bound-fixable" row in the fix-category table + the "Warnings ARE in scope for fix" section
- `images/security/CLAUDE.md` — the "What you MAY fix in-container" and "What you MUST NOT fix" sections

Rolled out via PR [#136](https://github.com/ConductionNL/hydra/pull/136), 2026-04-23.

- Observed failure: decidesk#73 security-review, 5+ cycles 2026-04-23 — 7 WARNING gate-7 findings across `MinutesVersionController`, `DecisionSearchController`, `NotificationSubscriptionController`; each cycle declined under the "no new DI" rule even though `MinutesApprovalController` in the same app already injected the needed `IUserSession` / `IGroupManager`.

### ADR-022-apps-consume-or-abstractions
# ADR-022: Apps Consume OpenRegister Abstractions

## Status
Proposed

## Date
2026-04-23

## Context

Conduction maintains ~13 Nextcloud apps (decidesk, docudesk, pipelinq, procest, opencatalogi, openconnector, mydash, larpingapp, shillinq/budgetq, zaakafhandelapp, nldesign, softwarecatalog, and the in-flight idea apps). Each app needs features that overlap heavily: objects with schemas, role-based access, audit trails, archival/retention policies, mapping/transformation, relation management, sidebar tabs with notes/tasks/files, dashboard widgets, integrations with NC-native and external services.

OpenRegister has grown into the **foundation** that provides these as shared abstractions: registers, schemas, objects, RBAC, audit-trail-immutable, archival-destruction-workflow, mappings, relations, object-interactions, and — with ADR-019 — a pluggable integration registry.

When a new app is built (or an existing app evolves), its authors face a choice: consume OR's abstraction, or build a parallel mechanism in-app. The "parallel mechanism" path is attractive at first — it's self-contained, it can be tweaked without coordinating with OR, and it avoids adding a dependency. But every instance observed so far has produced the same end state over time:

- **Duplicate data models** (an app-local Person vs OR contacts; an app-local AccessRule vs OR RBAC).
- **Drift** — app-local audit trails stop tracking things OR's audit does (replayable ordering, hash chains, retention-aware purge).
- **Missed features** — an app that rolled its own "linked files" sidebar never gets calendar/deck/polls/maps/collectives when OR adds them to the integration registry.
- **Impossible cross-app queries** — "show me all cases assigned to Jan across all Conduction apps" requires the contact linkage to be uniform.
- **Duplicate ADRs** — app-local ADRs restating what OR's already decided, then drifting.

ADR-019 codified the **mechanism** for one specific class of abstraction (integrations). This ADR codifies the **principle** that generalises: when OR has an abstraction that fits, apps consume it rather than reinvent.

## Decision

### Apps consume OpenRegister abstractions over local duplication

When an app needs functionality that OR already provides as an abstraction, the app MUST consume the OR abstraction. Rolling a parallel implementation in-app is not permitted unless explicitly justified (see "exceptions" below).

### What counts as an "OR abstraction"

Any capability exposed by OpenRegister that has a contract, a public API, and is documented as reusable. The current list (non-exhaustive):

| Abstraction | What it provides |
|---|---|
| **Registers + schemas + objects** | Versioned typed entities with validation, queries, events |
| **Authorization RBAC** | Role + scope + object-level permissions, per-schema and per-property |
| **Audit trail (immutable)** | Append-only hash-chained event log per object |
| **Archival + destruction workflow** | Retention classification, archival, purge — aligned with Archiefwet |
| **Mappings** | Cross-system transformation between source + target schemas |
| **Relations** | Typed links between OR objects |
| **Object interactions** (`object-interactions` spec) | Files, notes, tasks, tags, audit per object — the built-in part of the integration registry |
| **Integration registry (ADR-019)** | Pluggable NC-native + external integrations with tab+widget parity |
| **Audit hash chain** | Cryptographic verification of audit event order |
| **Content versioning** | Snapshot/restore of object states |
| **Deep link registry** | Cross-app navigation with stable object references |
| **TMLO metadata** | Dutch-gov metadata vocabulary compliance |
| **MCP discovery** | AI-agent discovery endpoint for all OR-backed capabilities |
| **Events + webhooks** | CloudEvents over NC's event dispatcher |

New abstractions land in OR via its own openspec process. When they're merged, this ADR's list updates.

### The positive case — how to consume

1. **Use OR's PHP service via DI injection.** Don't wrap it in an app-local service that adds nothing. Thin adapters are fine; duplication isn't.
2. **Register for OR's extensibility points.** The integration registry takes DI-tagged providers (ADR-019). RBAC takes scoped role definitions. Audit takes event listeners. Apps extend through these points, not by building parallel machinery.
3. **Follow OR's schemas when OR has a schema.** If OR already defines a `contact` or `case` or `organisation` model, an app using those concepts MUST reuse the OR schema and its register — not a local copy with the same-ish fields.
4. **Call OR's REST API from the frontend via `@conduction/nextcloud-vue`.** The shared library wraps OR's API; apps that bypass it and call OR's raw endpoints re-solve problems the shared lib already solved.

### Anti-patterns

These have all been observed and should be treated as review-blocking:

- **Parallel link tables.** An app creating its own `{app}_email_links` / `{app}_contact_links` table when OR's integration registry already provides the equivalent via `openregister_*_links`. (Observed via decidesk's initial CalDAV plan using `X-DECIDESK-*` properties duplicating OR's `X-OPENREGISTER-*` mechanism.)
- **App-local schema validators.** An app writing its own JSON schema validation when OR already validates against the schema it owns.
- **Home-grown audit trails.** An app writing to a private events table instead of OR's audit trail for actions on OR-owned objects.
- **App-local RBAC on OR objects.** An app defining its own role/permission scheme for objects that live in OR's register.
- **Duplicate sidebar tab systems.** An app registering its own object-sidebar tabs outside the integration registry (ADR-019).
- **App-local "linked bookmarks/files/notes/..." that mirror an OR integration.** If OR has an integration for it, the app consumes it.
- **Duplicate ADRs.** An app-local ADR restating an org-wide ADR. The stale copies of `adr-004-frontend.md` in app repos (removed 2026-04-19) are the canonical example.

### Exceptions (when an app may build a parallel mechanism)

A parallel mechanism is acceptable only when one of the following is true, **and documented in an app-local ADR that references this ADR and justifies the divergence**:

1. **Fundamentally different domain requirements.** The app's use-case has constraints OR can't satisfy (e.g., sub-millisecond latency, append-only write with no read, special encryption-at-rest keys per tenant).
2. **OR is blocked on a dependency the app can't wait for.** Time-sensitive delivery where adding the feature to OR would push out 3+ months, and the app ships its own interim solution with an explicit migration plan.
3. **Prototype / spike.** Temporary local code with a written sunset date (max 90 days) and an owner.

Every exception requires an app-local ADR. "We didn't know OR had this" is not an exception.

### Enforcement

- **Code review gate.** Reviewers reject PRs that duplicate an OR abstraction without an explicit ADR-backed justification.
- **Specter's spec generation** surfaces applicable OR abstractions in each app's context brief (ADR-019 already flows in via `generate_spec_content.py`). The expectation is that feature specs reference the OR abstraction they consume.
- **Hydra quality gate (future).** A mechanical gate that flags common anti-patterns — parallel link tables, duplicate ADR files, schema-validator reinvention, local RBAC code acting on OR objects. Tracked as a follow-up to this ADR; implementation issue to be opened separately.
- **This ADR list updates when OR adds an abstraction.** Keeping the list current is the OR team's responsibility; when a new abstraction becomes stable, it goes in this table via a small PR against this file.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **One source of truth per capability.** Features of files/notes/tasks/calendar/mail/contacts/etc. evolve in OR; every app benefits.
- **Cross-app consistency.** "Jan is the applicant on this case" means the same thing in procest, pipelinq, and zaakafhandelapp.
- **Smaller apps.** Each app ships less code because it consumes more. A new app in 2026 should be mostly schemas + app-specific business logic; the plumbing is OR.
- **Uniform audit/RBAC/retention.** Government compliance (Archiefwet, AVG, Woo, BIO) has one implementation to verify, not 13.
- **The integration registry compounds.** When OR adds the `integration-calendar` leaf, every app using OR objects gets meeting linkage without any per-app work.

### Negative

- **App authors need to learn OR's contracts.** The onboarding curve for a new Conduction developer includes understanding OR's schemas, RBAC model, audit trail, and integration registry. Mitigated by OR's docs + this ADR list.
- **OR becomes a bottleneck for shared changes.** If a capability needs a fix, OR has to ship it. Mitigated by keeping OR fast-moving + prioritising the long-tail abstractions that unblock multiple apps.
- **Exception discipline matters.** Without rigorous review of the app-local ADR justifications, exceptions become the norm. Mitigated by the code-review gate and the explicit sunset date on prototype exceptions.

### Migration

Apps currently in violation (openconnector's bespoke linked-entity handling, decidesk's X-DECIDESK-* CalDAV properties, app-local audit copies) are not required to migrate immediately. Each gets a tracked "consume-OR-abstraction" issue with a target date. See the openregister integration registry umbrella ([openregister#1307](https://github.com/ConductionNL/openregister/issues/1307)) for the calendar/email/deck/contacts/talk migration pattern.

### ADR-023-action-authorization
# ADR-023: Action-level authorization via admin-configured action/group mappings

**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-04-23

## Context

Conduction apps mix **data authorization** (who can read/write which OpenRegister objects) and **action authorization** (who can invoke which controller methods / workflow steps). The two are related but not the same:

- A chair of "Board A" can read all Board A minutes (data RBAC → OpenRegister) AND can invoke `generateMinutesDraft()` on them (action RBAC → app).
- A regular member of Board A can read the same minutes (data RBAC → OpenRegister) but CANNOT invoke `generateMinutesDraft()` (action RBAC denies).
- A Nextcloud admin can invoke `create()` on `SettingsController` (action RBAC → admin-only) regardless of any board membership.

OpenRegister already owns the **data** layer: object-level ownership, schema/register permissions, per-relation filtering (ADR-022 lists RBAC as one of the shared abstractions it provides). Apps consume this cleanly.

Apps DO NOT have a shared pattern for the **action** layer. Observed across decidesk / docudesk / pipelinq, the action-auth implementations range from:

- `IGroupManager::isAdmin()` hardcoded checks in controller bodies (wrong — locks governance actions to Nextcloud sysadmins, not to chairs/secretaries — see #44 / #45 on 2026-04-23)
- Missing entirely (the endpoint gates on data RBAC alone — wrong for actions that cross objects, like "generate report across all boards I chair")
- Inline `!in_array('chair', $roles)` checks that are (a) not discoverable by admins, (b) require a code change to adjust, (c) duplicated across controllers

The consistent answer needs to: live in app code (each app has its own actions), be **declarative** (admin can see and change the matrix without touching code), and be **testable** (gate-7 / gate-9 can mechanically verify each routed action either delegates to this service or is explicitly marked admin-only).

## Decision

### Rule 1 — Data RBAC is OpenRegister's job; apps never roll their own

OpenRegister decides for itself who may read / write / list which objects. App code that fetches, lists, or mutates domain objects MUST go through OpenRegister's `ObjectService` and trust the service's filtering + per-object permissions. Apps do not implement:

- Object-ownership checks (OpenRegister does it via `createdBy` / `owner` / schema settings)
- Register/schema-level access gates (OpenRegister does it via register permissions)
- Group-based read/write filtering on data (OpenRegister does it via `relations.group` / schema RBAC)
- Schema / register configuration (that's OpenRegister's own admin UI, not the consuming app's)

If the data-layer RBAC has a gap, **fix it in OpenRegister** (ADR-012 — push logic up to the shared foundation, don't re-implement per app).

### Rule 2 — Action RBAC is the app's job, declared in admin settings

Every app defines a registry of **actions** — named operations that a controller method executes. Examples (decidesk):

- `minutes.generate-draft` — produces a draft from a meeting transcript
- `minutes.distribute` — sends final minutes to the governance body
- `decision.publish` — marks a decision as published, triggers notifications
- `analytics.view-summary` — reads aggregate metrics across bodies
- `settings.write` — admin-only settings writes

Each action is mapped to a set of **user groups** via an admin-configured matrix, stored in `IAppConfig` under a well-known key. Every app maintains its own seed data for the initial mapping; the template ships a skeleton file per app that declares the action list with `["admin"]` as the default for every action. This default is **the safest first-install posture** — nothing is accidentally opened to non-admins until an admin explicitly broadens it. The admin settings panel is the only place to edit the matrix.

```json
// stored as IAppConfig["decidesk"]["actions"]
//
// First-install values (seed from the app, admin-only everywhere).
// The admin editing the matrix is the only path to broaden — code
// changes must not relax the default.
{
  "minutes.generate-draft":   ["admin"],
  "minutes.distribute":       ["admin"],
  "decision.publish":         ["admin"],
  "analytics.view-summary":   ["admin"],
  "settings.write":           ["admin"]
}
```

After admin customization (example — illustrative, not default):

```json
{
  "minutes.generate-draft":   ["chairs", "secretaries"],
  "minutes.distribute":       ["chairs", "secretaries"],
  "decision.publish":         ["chairs"],
  "analytics.view-summary":   ["chairs", "secretaries", "board-members"],
  "settings.write":           ["admin"]
}
```

**Naming convention**: `<domain>.<verb-phrase>` with dot as separator, lowercase, hyphens-in-phrases. `minutes.generate-draft`, `decision.publish`, `analytics.view-summary`. NOT `decidesk:minutes:generateDraft`. This keeps the keys grep-friendly, stable across refactors, and matches how schema keys look in OpenRegister.

The **admin settings panel** (registered via `\OCP\Settings\ISection`, route carries `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting(Application::APP_ID)]`) renders this matrix: rows = actions, columns = user groups, checkboxes = allowed. Admin edits + saves → `IAppConfig` updated. NO code change required to adjust who can do what.

Controllers enforce the mapping with a single helper call:

```php
#[NoAdminRequired]
public function generateDraft(string $minutesId): JSONResponse {
    $user = $this->userSession->getUser();
    if ($user === null) {
        return new JSONResponse(['error' => 'Not authenticated'], Http::STATUS_UNAUTHORIZED);
    }

    $this->actionAuth->requireAction($user, 'minutes.generate-draft');
    // Throws OCSForbiddenException if none of $user's groups are mapped
    // to 'minutes.generate-draft' in the admin matrix.

    // ... data-layer work via ObjectService (OpenRegister enforces its own
    //     per-object permissions on top of this action check).
}
```

### Rule 3 — When admin IS required (not delegated to action RBAC)

The following stay `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting(Application::APP_ID)]` and live **only on the admin settings page** — they are NOT expressible as action mappings because they are the plumbing the action matrix itself depends on:

- **Configuring the action ↔ group matrix** (the admin settings panel itself)
- **App configuration** — any `IAppConfig` writes (feature flags, feature toggles, workflow parameters, anything that affects app-wide behavior)
- **Backup / restore operations** — data export, re-import, cross-environment migration
- **App integration configuration** — connections to external systems (n8n, SOLR, external APIs), webhook URLs, integration feature flags
- **Credential management** — API keys, OAuth tokens, basic-auth credentials for any third-party service
- **One-off admin operations** — re-import seed data, purge caches, run migrations, trigger re-indexing

Everything a non-admin (chair / secretary / board-member / agent / regular user) might legitimately invoke during normal operation = an **action**, gated via `requireAction()`. Admin settings page handles the plumbing; user settings page / per-user UI never touches the plumbing. The user settings page is for user-personal preferences only (UI theme, notification opt-ins) — not for anything the action matrix references.

Rule of thumb: if the operation mutates something the action matrix references (keys the matrix looks up, values the matrix resolves to, integrations the actions depend on) → admin. Everything else → action.

### Rule 4 — Middleware attribute + body check layered

Per ADR-005 and ADR-016:

- `#[PublicPage]` — genuinely public (login pages, OAuth callbacks). Body does NO auth check.
- `#[NoAdminRequired]` — any authenticated user may reach the endpoint. Body **MUST** call `$this->actionAuth->requireAction($user, 'action.name')` for action-level gating. Absence of this call is a gate-9 failure — see enforcement below.
- `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting(Application::APP_ID)]` — framework-level admin gate for the exceptions in Rule 3. Body does no further admin check (the middleware already enforced it).

### Rule 5 — Gate-9 enforces the action-auth pattern mechanically

`hydra-gate-9` (semantic-auth) is extended to check:

| Pattern | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `#[NoAdminRequired]` + body calls `$this->actionAuth->requireAction(...)` | PASS |
| `#[NoAdminRequired]` + body calls `$this->authorize*(...)` (per-object auth helper per ADR-005 Rule 3) | PASS |
| `#[NoAdminRequired]` + body calls `$this->requireAdmin()` / `isAdmin()===false`→403 | FAIL — the wrong layer; use `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting]` for admin-only or `requireAction()` for role-based |
| `#[NoAdminRequired]` + no recognized auth gate in body | FAIL — inadequately gated, open endpoint |
| `#[PublicPage]` + any body auth check | FAIL — public is public, no body checks |
| `#[AuthorizedAdminSetting]` + `requireAction()` in body | PASS but redundant (middleware already gated to admin) — not a fail, but the lint could suggest removal |

Enforcement rolls out in two phases to give apps time to migrate without breaking their pipelines:

1. **Soft-fail phase** (announce in ADR): gate emits warnings, doesn't fail the gate. Apps that haven't migrated yet stay green.
2. **Hard-fail phase** (date-stamped): gate treats missing `requireAction()` as FAIL. Decided when majority of apps have adopted the pattern.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Governance actions (minutes drafting, decision publishing, quorum checks) can be delegated to chairs / secretaries / board members — NOT Nextcloud sysadmins. Current decidesk bug class (#44 + #45) goes away structurally.
- Admins can re-map actions to groups without a code change — useful when an org shifts responsibilities mid-deployment.
- One helper (`$this->actionAuth->requireAction()`) per gated method — consistent, grep-able, testable.
- Gate-7 / gate-9 enforcement has a clear target to check for (`requireAction()` call in body).
- Template repo ships this out of the box — new apps inherit the pattern instead of each rolling their own.

### Negative
- Initial setup burden: admin must populate the action matrix on first install. Mitigated with sensible defaults in `create-labels`-style seed data per app.
- Two layers of auth per request (action matrix check + OpenRegister per-object check) = two service calls per gated endpoint. Negligible cost (both are app-local memory or indexed DB).
- Admin who mis-configures the matrix can lock chairs out of essential actions. Mitigated with a "reset to defaults" button + `occ decidesk:actions:reset`.

### Neutral
- Replaces "lock everything to admin" over-restriction with "configurable by admin" flexibility. For ops that currently have only Nextcloud admins, the first-install default can be "admin-only" per action — the matrix is editable but the safe default survives if nobody touches it.

## Implementation plan

1. **This ADR** — accepted.
2. **Reference implementation in decidesk**:
   - New `OCA\Decidesk\Service\ActionAuthService` with `requireAction(IUser $user, string $action): void` — throws `OCSForbiddenException` when $user's groups don't intersect the matrix entry for $action
   - New `OCA\Decidesk\Settings\ActionMatrixAdmin` settings section (`\OCP\Settings\ISettings` + template) showing the action×group matrix, admin-only
   - `IAppConfig` key `decidesk.actions` storing the JSON mapping
   - Refactor the 13 + 2 controller methods caught by gate-9 on #44 / #45 to use `requireAction()`
   - **Seed data per app** — each app ships its own `actions.seed.json` (or equivalent) declaring the action list with `["admin"]` as default. App migration runs it on first install.
3. **Port to `nextcloud-app-template`**: copy `ActionAuthService` + skeleton settings panel + seed-data pattern. Parametrized so new apps just declare their action names. Default values all `["admin"]`.
4. **Gate-9 extension (soft-fail phase first)**:
   - Detect `#[NoAdminRequired]` + body-has-`requireAction()`-call → PASS
   - Detect `#[NoAdminRequired]` + body-has-`authorize*()`-call (per-object auth per ADR-005) → PASS
   - Detect `#[NoAdminRequired]` + no recognized gate → emit warning (soft-fail)
   - Detect `#[NoAdminRequired]` + `requireAdmin()` / `isAdmin()===false` → FAIL (hard — the wrong layer)
   - Warnings hit the verdict JSON but do not set the gate to FAIL during migration.
5. **Migrate existing apps** (hydra, decidesk first, then docudesk / pipelinq / procest / …) to the new pattern.
6. **Gate-9 hard-fail phase**: after apps are migrated, flip warnings → fails. Date-stamp to set on the PR that ships the hard-fail variant.
7. **Unblock #44 + #45**: once decidesk has `ActionAuthService`, their 13+2 methods plug into `requireAction('minutes.generate-draft')` etc. The current parked state resolves as a retry cycle.
