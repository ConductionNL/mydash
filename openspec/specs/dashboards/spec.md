# Dashboards Specification

## Purpose

Dashboards are the core organizational unit in MyDash. Each user can create and manage multiple personal dashboards, each acting as a container for widget placements, tiles, and layout configuration. Dashboards define the grid structure, permission level, and active state. Only one dashboard can be active per user at a time, serving as their landing page when they open Nextcloud. Dashboards can also be of type `admin_template`, managed by administrators for distribution to users.

## Data Model

Each dashboard record is stored in the `oc_mydash_dashboards` table with the following fields:
- **id**: Auto-increment integer primary key
- **uuid**: Unique identifier (UUID v4)
- **userId**: Nextcloud user ID of the dashboard owner
- **name**: Human-readable dashboard name
- **description**: Optional description of the dashboard purpose
- **type**: Either `user` (personal) or `admin_template` (admin-managed template)
- **active**: Boolean flag indicating if this is the user's currently active dashboard
- **grid_columns**: Number of grid columns (default: 12)
- **permission_level**: One of `view_only`, `add_only`, `full` (inherited from template or set by admin)

## Requirements

### REQ-DASH-001: Create Personal Dashboard

Users MUST be able to create new personal dashboards with a name, optional description, and default grid configuration.

#### Scenario: Create a dashboard with default settings

#### Scenario: Update grid columns on a dashboard with existing widgets
- GIVEN user "alice" has dashboard id 5 with `grid_columns: 12` and 4 widget placements
- WHEN she sends PUT /api/dashboard/5 with body `{"grid_columns": 6}`
- THEN the system MUST update `grid_columns` to 6
- AND widget placements that exceed the new column count SHOULD be repositioned or flagged for re-layout

#### Scenario: Update permission_level on a user dashboard
- GIVEN user "alice" has a personal dashboard with `permission_level: full`
- WHEN she sends PUT /api/dashboard/5 with body `{"permission_level": "view_only"}`
- THEN the system MUST return HTTP 400 or ignore the field
- AND users MUST NOT be able to change permission_level on their own dashboards (only inherited from templates or set by admin)

### REQ-DASH-005: Delete Dashboard

Users MUST be able to delete their own dashboards.

#### Scenario: Delete a dashboard
- GIVEN user "alice" has dashboard id 5 with 3 widget placements
- WHEN she sends DELETE /api/dashboard/5

- AND the two dashboards MUST be distinguishable by their id and uuid

### REQ-DASH-008: Dashboard Type Enforcement

The `type` field MUST distinguish between user-created dashboards and admin templates, with appropriate access controls.

#### Scenario: Users cannot create admin_template type dashboards
- GIVEN a non-admin user "alice"
